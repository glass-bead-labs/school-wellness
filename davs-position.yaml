title: Dav's position on mental health and wellness in schools
notes:
  - Should tags and entities be separate things. cf. NIH and the way I link to
    it.
  - How do we differentiate links meant to identify vs. links meant to be part
    of the rhetorical structure? I think this implies at least two different
    kinds of links/things
  - We don't have authority to define canonical entities in other organizations
    (e.g., where we don't pay the rental fee on the domain)
  - Maybe we should use a well-defined subset of YAML, cf. multiline strings

  NIH: gov.nih (entity we can resolve in our schema) OR
